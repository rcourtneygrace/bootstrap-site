        <p class="publication item-b">Gadgethacks.com | May 24, 2019</p>
        <p class="description item-c">If you want your photos to look like they came straight out of a movie scene, the
            best method is to use split toning. Many Hollywood producers use this effect to recreate the cinematic look
            of cameras before the digital film era, which is why most people associate split toning with a cinematic
            feel... </p>

        <p class="publication item-b">Gadgethacks.com  | April 10, 2019</p>
        <p class="description item-c">It's difficult to find that perfect lighting when you're taking a photo. You won't
            always have studio lights — or at all — and you're not always out during golden hour. So how can you combat
            lighting issues without waiting around for a well-lit condition? Do it in post. Adobe's Photoshop Express
            makes it easy to fix and even customize the lighting in your photos using the right adjustments... </p>

        <p class="publication item-b">Gadgethacks.com | April 8, 2019</p>
        <p class="description item-c">Just like Instagram, Photoshop Express for Android and iOS has its own set of
            filters you can quickly apply to any photo. It's simple, fast, and more customizable than using Instagram's
            pre-made filters. The options in Photoshop Express allow you to edit and change your filters to be exactly
            to your liking. Then, you can even save those edits as your own custom filters... </p>
